BUG - 
    URL remains "/settings" after logout
EFFECT -
    Have to reload page for "login" functionalities to work after logging out.

BUG - 
    user does not load in the session after manual login but it loads when using social-auth (only if we use client component for displaying data, works fine when using server component)
EFFECT -
    Have to reload page for "user" to load after manual login.


JUGAAD FOR TOW BUGS ABOVE - use client component for data-fetching and client component for logout

Also, when updating data in the settings page, the updated data is shown immediately on the client page but it takes some time to load on the server page. soultion - reload the page using useEffect

FROM STACK OVERFLOW - I would always recommend fetching data on the server component and pass the menuData to a child component. That child component could be a client component or another server component based on what you are doing. For a better visualization, here is a blog from vercel.
